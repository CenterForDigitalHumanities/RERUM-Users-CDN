* @description  
This module includes a custom `<button is="auth-button">` element for authentication within 
 the RERUM Users Cohort.
* Notes: 
  - Include this module and a button[is='auth-button'] element to use. 
  - Add the `disabled` property on any page that should be available to the public, but knowing the user may be helpful.
  - This can be made more generic by passing in the constants and parameterizing {app:'dla'}.
